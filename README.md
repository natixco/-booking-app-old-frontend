# Booking app
This is a project that we (me and @KDani-99) made and was abandoned. The idea was to give a way for companies and entrepreneurs to let their customers to schedule an appointment for their services (for example: a barber, dentist or even a manage a yoga class).
## Used technologies
Frontend was made in Angular 8, backend (https://github.com/KDani-99/booking-app-old) is NodeJS hosted with ExpressJS.
## Notes
- Do not use the app in production. It may have security issues due to outdated packages.
- The name *Bookly* has nothing to do with real in-production apps.
